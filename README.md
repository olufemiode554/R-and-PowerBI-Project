Aim: To analyze the performance of Hollywood movies 

Data: Title, genre, studio, profitability and ratings for movies released 2007-2012. Source: InformationIsBeautiful.net

first task
I was given a data set about Performance of Hollywood Movies. I have uploaded that data set into PositCloud where I have analysed and cleansed the data with R.

 Please see cleansed R Script in my uploaded Folder.
 
 After extracting my clean data set from R, I have uploaded it into PowerBi to create an easy to read visual for the client to see. The client requested to see:
• The average ratings of each genre • The number of movies produced per year • The audience scores for each film
• The profitability per studio • The worldwide gross per genre
I have also included:
• The sum of worst movies per genre • The number of years in every genre The client request the use of their brand colours which is blue, brown and green.
